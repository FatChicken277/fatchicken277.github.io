The IoT or also called by its acronym internet of things is one of the most important issues today because it allows machines to connect to the internet and generate useful data for the user, but what is the internet of things? or how can we describe it in a better way ?, because according to the most accurate definitions the internet of things is:

> "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to -human or human-to-computer interaction" Wikipedia

> "In a nutshell, the Internet of Things is the concept of connecting any device (so long as it has an on/off switch) to the Internet and to other connected devices. The IoT is a giant network of connected things and people â€“ all of which collect and share data about the way they are used and about the environment around them." IBM

> "Simply put, this is the concept of basically connecting any device with an on and off switch to the Internet (and/or to each other). " Forbes

Then we can draw some conclusions from this definitions, for example if a watch is capable of monitoring your health and is also capable of generating useful statistics for the user, that watch can be considered within the field of the internet of things, but this is only An example of the magnitude of this issue, since a single clock may not be relevant, but thousands of clocks that can alert their users about possible health problems can make a difference in a society which is increasingly dependent on electronic devices thus giving a giant value to the internet of things.

Sounds great, doesn't it? Well, the truth is that more and more devices that before did not have the scope that the internet provides us today are very useful and are used more and more.

## **How it works**

Electronic devices with sensors that allow them to communicate with the internet and store data that may be important to improve the effectiveness of the device autonomously and intelligently.

These devices can classify the information in such a way that they can discard irrelevant information in order to deliver more reliable and more useful results.

This could be an example of how communication is done between devices:

## **Cybersecurity**

Although the truth is that there are some problems when it comes to the implementation of new smart technologies because their costs are too high and the privacy of the user is endangered.

so thanks to these new technologies it is essential to create new laws that protect consumers as well as their data privacy.

In addition to this, it is essential to take into account that like any technology we must have good management practices and also we ourselves are in charge of giving it a responsible use and being able to realize the value of our data and thus be able to protect ourselves.

but the excuse of security should not be an impediment to avoid the massive arrival of these new technologies, on the contrary we must be aware that it is necessary and even more so in these times so I want to leave some computer security recommendations

1. Improve password security: it is very important to keep our passwords safe by having a long pattern of digits since strange characters are not very important when it comes to keeping systems safe, and avoid always using the same passwords.

2. Choose secure networks: we must take into account with whom or with whom we are sharing our information and where and that is why it is important to choose our networks well, we must always avoid public or low-trust networks and give priority to personal networks.

3. Keep all of your personal electronic device software current: this is one of the most important but it is one of the least we take into account since we must always update our software or hardware to avoid cyber attacks and always keep with the best and most catualized protection available

taking into account these 3 simple tips we can give way to the internet of things and any new technology of the future.

## **Conclusion**

Today the internet of things is advanced very quickly, which is good, so we must continue to invest in this kind of technology because its objective is that most objects are permanently connected to the Internet to improve their functionality, Among other possible uses, this ensures us a better future since we can apply it in too many fields, both in the professional, educational, political, etc.

Without a doubt, the internet of things is and will continue to change the world as we perceive it today.
